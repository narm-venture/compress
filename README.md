compress
========
JPEG image compression algorithm has been partly implemented using opencv liraries
Huffman encoding has not been implmented.
The output of run level encoding of each macroblock has been commented out.
The program takes an input image (preferable large), compresses it by eliminating high spatial frequencies and 
shows the output image.
